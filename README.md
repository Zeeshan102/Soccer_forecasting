#Soccer Match Prediction & World Cup Simulation
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the outcome of soccer matches and simulate the 2018 FIFA World Cup tournament to analyze the most probable winners.

#Project Overview
Objective: Predict the outcome of soccer matches based on historical match data and use the model to simulate the 2018 FIFA World Cup tournament.
Data: Historical match results (30,000+ matches), teams information, and the list of teams qualified for the 2018 World Cup.
#Key Deliverables
Match Prediction Model: A machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a soccer match given the teams.
World Cup Simulation: A program that simulates the 2018 FIFA World Cup 1,000 times using the model to predict each match.
